# Helpdesk-Operating-System

This is a project part of Team Projects module in my University where it required a team of 5 members to come up with a Helpdesk Operating System for our client where we have created a prototype, showed to our clients, fixed the necessary changes and created the final product. 

This file contains all the necessary code to run PHP Laravel framework and documentation required to understand the project.
